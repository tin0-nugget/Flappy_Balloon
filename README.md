# Flappy_Balloon
Flappy Balloon is simple vertical jumping game where the player is a balloon who is trying to reach its friend (another balloon) to be happy. On the way it collects coins for itself because it needs money. The code for the game is written by Nghia Nguyen (me). The art work is created by Hoang Le. Special thanks to Thanh Phan for testing the game.
